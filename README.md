# codehunt-data-cs
Code Hunt Data Helper, C# version (see also: [Python version][py])

This is intended to help with analyzing data from the Code Hunt Data
Release 1 by parsing the filenames and providing code for querying the
[Code Hunt REST API](https://api.codehunt.com/) as well as showing an
example of using [Roslyn][roslyn] to parse the user code.

See `codehunt-data-example/Program.cs` for a simple example of using this code.
